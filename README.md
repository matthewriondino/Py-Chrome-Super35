# Py-Chrome-Super35
Py-Chrome Super35 is a dedicated video CIR conversion tool that subtracts IR signal from the red and green channel then rearranges the channel mapping as an IRG layout. The program then exports clips 1 to 1  from import, making it suitable to grade after conversion. A full spectrum camera is required with a yellow 12 filter
